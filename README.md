# My Rice
My i3 setup.

# Installing 
Checkout the install list to see what is needed to be installed for all of this
to work correctly. If you're running Arch Linux, you should be able to run
install_packages.sh (with it's required arguments) to install all the needed dependancies.

# Some Notes
Some of my paths in .scripts are hardcoded to my home path, the best way to find
these would be 

# Setting Up i3.
This section will go into lite detail how to use my files to setup i3.

  Running/ reading setup.sh will show you the locations of where the files
  belong at least in my setup. 

# Other Distros
This does work on other distros, I've helped others with setting this up on
Ubuntu, however I remember it being a chore finding some of the more obscure 
dependancies. This however might no longer be the case as this was done quiet 
some time ago.
